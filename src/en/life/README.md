# Life

::: info  Life
Storing some fragments of life, what is life? I believe a happy person has a very specific understanding. I think my life is full of music, experiencing beautiful notes and infecting the tastes of different creators; Watching a lot of movies enhances the visual experience of different cultures, emotions, and visuals; It's about reading a lot of books, savoring the words carefully, and feeling more delicate expressions between the lines. Life is beautiful, please love it, no matter what the reality is.
